    <h2>AIMS</h2>
    	</center>
      <p>'Walking' is not easy to do because people do not know how long it takes to reach a proper amount of exercise.</p> <p>This service, designed to address such concerns, works in conjunction with maps to calculate the location and distance users are currently walking.</p>

    <h2>TARGET AUDIENCE</h2>
    	<p>It will be an app that help people who want to exercise steadily but don't have the will to do it, or people who exercise to maintain their health.</p>
      <p>By competing with friends or others, Users can get motivation for exercising and check how much they have done a workout.</p>

    <h2>BRANDING</h2>
    This logo is made by combining icons that represents a location and a walk.

    <div class="colour">
        <h2>VISUAL DIRECTION</h2>
        <p>The default colour used in the overall design is light blue.</p>
        <p>This colour forms the main UI, and yellow is used as the point colour for the button or icon.</p>
        <p>Since two colours are pretty vivid so light grey is also used to balance the design.</p>
         <img src="img/colour.jpg" alt="Colours">
        </div>

        <p>Since serif fonts have a conservative image, I have determined that the sans serif font is a good fit for Walkaholic.</p>
        <p>Not Sans is the main font used for menu elements and Nanum Gothic is used for the content of the text.</p>
